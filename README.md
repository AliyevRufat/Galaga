2DAEGD01 - Programming 4 Retake Assignment

About engine and design choices :

	The engine uses a Game Loop ,an Update method and some programming patterns. Those are component , command 
	, observer , singleton , state and event queue patterns. I also used singletons to make managers for specific 
	gameobjects in the game like the enemies and colliders. Multithreading was also used for in game sounds.
