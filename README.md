2DAEGD01 - Programming 4 Assignment

About engine and design choices :

	The engine uses a Game Loop ,an Update method and some programming patterns. Those are component , command 
	, observer , singleton and event queue patterns. I also used singletons to make managers for specific 
	gameobjects in the game like the enemies. Multithreading was also used for in game sounds.


Game Controls: 
	Controller:
		D pad for movement, Select button to close the game
		Y to go to main menu
		X to start single player Mode
		A to start Co op Mode
		B to start Versus Mode
	Keyboard:
		W A S D for movement, Escape to close the game
		U to go to main menu
		I to start single player Mode
		O to start Co op Mode
		P to start Versus Mode
